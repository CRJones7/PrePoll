# PrePoll

This is the first iteration of the Prepoll webapp. The purpose of this web application is to allow a member to stay up to date on the latest political updates through a culmination of news sources, prepare them for voting by supplying all candidates in local and national elections, and inform them about local conditions through census community servey data. The user is able to save news articles that are important to them, view all candidates, and save notes on their opinions of candidates, as well as view state census data and sourt through county census data.
